# SPP - Safe Persistent Pointers

This repository containts the compiler passes and associated runtime for Safe Persistent Pointers (SPP).

## Installation instructions

### Automated project build

We rely on [nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager to reliably build the environment for SPP.

If you do not run NixOS, you can still use the [nix package manager](https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-install-nix-package-manager/).

SPP has 3 core components:
1. A fork of LLVM (as a submodule) containing the SPP passes ([llvm-project](./llvm-project/))
2. The SPP runtime library ([runtime](./runtime/))
3. A fork of PMDK (as a submodule) containing the SPP wrappers ([pmdk](./pmdk/))

To easily build all of the above we provide the `install_dependencies.sh` script.

Simply execute (takes some minutes):
```console
$ ./install_dependencies.sh
```

After this point, you can launch a ```nix-shell``` and the provided environment will contain:
- all the required dependecies
- all the required environment variables (```CC```, ```CXX```, ```CMAKE_C_COMPILER```, ```CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER```, ```BINUTILS_DIR```, ```PMEM_MMAP_HINT```, ```PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE```)

Simply run:
```console
$ nix-shell
nix-shell> # in this shell all build dependencies are present
```

#### Notes on `install_dependencies.sh`
The `install_dependencies.sh` script performs the following actions:
1. Initializes the repository by fetching all the submodules
2. Applies a patch to `default.nix` required to have the default `gcc` compiler to build LLVM.
3. Builds the `llvm-project` inside a ```nix-shell``` based on the patched `default.nix` containing all the dependencies.
4. Reverts the changes of the `default.nix`.
5. Builds the `SPP runtime library` using the freshly compiled `clang` from step 3.
6. Builds the `pmdk` and applies the SPP passes to its examples and benchmarks (`pmembench`) using the freshly compiled `clang` from step 3. Note that by default, it builds SPP with **TAG_BITS set to 26**.


### Manual project build
You can also build the project manually (step by step).
In the next steps, we define `PROJECT_ROOT` as the root directory of this repository.

1. **Initialise the submodules of the repository:**
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. **Build the `llvm-project`:**

Apply the `install_depndencies.patch` to temporarily use the normal `gcc` compiler for the LLVM,
enter a ```nix-shell```, run the build instructions for LLVM with gold plugin (**Warning!** High memory consumption) and exit the ```nix-shell```:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git apply build_dependencies.patch
$ nix-shell
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/llvm-project
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir -p build
$ mkdir -p install
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DLLVM_BINUTILS_INCDIR=$BINUTILS_DIR  \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;clang-tools-extra" \
  -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/llvm ../llvm
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ exit
```

3. **Bulld the `SPP runtime library`:**

Revert the `default.nix` to its original form, enter a ```nix-shell``` that wraps the compiler with the `clang` compiled in step 2, fetches all the dependencies and sets the appropriate environment variables, compile the runtime library and exit the ```nix-shell```:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git checkout default.nix
$ nix-shell
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/runtime
$ make clean && make
$ exit
```

Optional compile parameter for `SPP runtime library`: `TAG_BITS` to determine the tag size for the returned tagged pointer structure.

**Important**: If you use this parameter, this has to be passed to `SPP PMDK` building phase below (Step 4) as well as to any compiling module of your own (so that it does not mess up with the internal struct definitions).

4. **Build the `SPP PMDK` fork:**

Revert the `default.nix` to its original form, enter a ```nix-shell``` that wraps the compiler with the `clang` compiled in step 2 and fetches all the dependencies and sets the appropriate environment variables, compile the `SPP PMDK` fork and exit the ```nix-shell```:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git checkout default.nix
$ nix-shell
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk
$ git checkout spp-pm_ptr_bit
$ make clean -j$(nproc)
$ make clobber -j$(nproc)
$ make -j$(nproc) TAG_BITS=xx
$ exit
```

Optional compile parameter for `SPP PMDK`: `TAG_BITS` to determine the tag size for the returned tagged pointer structure.

**Important**: If you use this parameter, this has to be passed to `SPP runtime library` building phase above (Step 3) as well as to any compiling module of your own (so that it does not mess up with the internal struct definitions).

5. **Enter in the ```nix-shell``` with all the dependencies and built projects:**
```console
$ nix-shell
nix-shell> # in this shell all build dependencies are present
```

The nix-shell already exports the ```CC```, ```CXX```, ```CMAKE_C_COMPILER```, ```CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER```, ```BINUTILS_DIR```, ```PMEM_MMAP_HINT```, ```PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE``` environment variables.

## Usage instructions

Disable mapping address randomization and provide PMDK with appropriately low mapping address hint ([src](https://pmem.io/pmdk/manpages/linux/v1.0/libpmem.3.html)):
```
export PMEM_MMAP_HINT=0
```

If your machine is not equipped with PM, export the following flag to use `flush` instructions instead of `msync`:
```
export PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE=1
```

### Minimal example execution

In the `examples` folder you can find a minimal example which can be built and run with the launch.sh script.
```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/examples/
./launch.sh
```
The script also produces the original and transformed LLVM-IR for the simple `example.c` code.

#### Note
Currently the passes produce a lot of debug messages. In order to control the debug information, someone can comment out the defined `DEBUG` variables in `runtime/src/spp.c`, `llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/SPP/spp.cpp` and `llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/IPO/SPPLTO.cpp`.

## Code structure

### Directories
`benchmarks`: folder containing the benchmark scripts

`llvm-project`: llvm fork that contains and registers the passes needed for SPP

`runtime`: runtime library for the hook functions

`pmdk`: pmdk fork that contains the modified libpmemobj that uses the enhanced `PMEMoid` structure and constructs the appropriate `tagged pointers`

### Important files

`runtime/src/spp.c`: hook functions implementation

`llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/SPP/spp.cpp`: SPP module pass implementation

`llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/IPO/SPPLTO.cpp`: LTO pass implementation

### How to run pmembench
First make sure that you have correctly compiled `llvm/clang` as defined above and you use the ```nix-shell``` to use the appropriate wrappers.

Compile PMDK and the instrumented pmembench benchmarks (uses the default number of tag bits):
```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk/
make clobber
make clean
make -j$(nproc) 
```
Run the `pmembench` with the `pmembench_map.cfg` (persistent indices) and `pmembench_tx_spp.cfg` (PM management operations):
```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk/src/benchmarks
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../nondebug ./pmembench pmembench_map.cfg
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../nondebug ./pmembench pmembench_tx_spp.cfg
```
Note that this execution redirects the output to `stdout`. To store it in a file, simply redirect it to the file of your choice.

For the PMDK baseline, compile the native PMDK with:
```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk/
make clobber
make clean
make -j$(nproc) SPP_OFF=1
```
Then run again the `pmembench` commands as explained above.

### How to run the tests
After you have successfully compiled `llvm` and the runtime library, you can run our sample tests from the root directory:
```
OPT_LEVEL=1 ./spp_test.sh
```
or
```
OPT_LEVEL=2 ./spp_test.sh
```
depending on the optimization level that you want your binaries to be compiled with.
Note that this command will create a build directory where it will place the binaries,
build the `pmdk`, generate the transformed IRs and run the tests. 
The IRs and the binaries are placed in `build/tests` folder.
