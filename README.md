# SPP - Safe Persistent Pointers

This repository containts the compiler passes and associated runtime for Safe Persistent Pointers (SPP) for Persistent Memory (PM).

## Installation instructions

### Automated project build

We rely on [nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager to reliably build the environment for SPP.

If you do not run NixOS, you can still use the [nix package manager](https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-install-nix-package-manager/).

SPP has 3 core components:
1. A fork of LLVM (as a submodule) containing the SPP passes ([llvm-project](./llvm-project/))
2. The SPP runtime library ([runtime](./runtime/))
3. A fork of PMDK (as a submodule) containing the SPP wrappers ([pmdk](./pmdk/))

To easily build all of the above we provide the `install_dependencies.sh` script.

Simply execute (takes some minutes):
```console
$ ./install_dependencies.sh
```

After this point, you can launch a ```nix-shell``` and the provided environment will contain:
- all the required dependecies
- all the required environment variables (```CC```, ```CXX```, ```CMAKE_C_COMPILER```, ```CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER```, ```BINUTILS_DIR```, ```PMEM_MMAP_HINT```, ```PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE```)

Simply run:
```console
$ nix-shell
nix-shell> # in this shell all build dependencies are present
```

#### Notes on `install_dependencies.sh`
The `install_dependencies.sh` script performs the following actions:
1. Initializes the repository by fetching all the submodules
2. Applies a patch to `default.nix` required to have the default `gcc` compiler to build LLVM.
3. Builds the `llvm-project` inside a ```nix-shell``` based on the patched `default.nix` containing all the dependencies.
4. Reverts the changes of the `default.nix`.
5. Builds the `SPP runtime library` using the freshly compiled `clang` from step 3.
6. Builds the `pmdk` and applies the SPP passes to its examples and benchmarks (`pmembench`) using the freshly compiled `clang` from step 3. Note that by default, it builds SPP with **TAG_BITS set to 26**.


### Manual project build
You can also build the project manually (step by step).
In the next steps, we define `PROJECT_ROOT` as the root directory of this repository.

1. **Initialise the submodules of the repository:**
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. **Build the `llvm-project`:**

Apply the `install_depndencies.patch` to temporarily use the normal `gcc` compiler for the LLVM,
enter a ```nix-shell```, run the build instructions for LLVM with gold plugin (**Warning!** High memory consumption) and exit the ```nix-shell```:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git apply build_dependencies.patch
$ nix-shell
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/llvm-project
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir -p build
$ mkdir -p install
$ cd build
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DLLVM_BINUTILS_INCDIR=$BINUTILS_DIR  \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;clang-tools-extra" \
  -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/llvm ../llvm
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ exit
```

3. **Bulld the `SPP runtime library`:**

Revert the `default.nix` to its original form, enter a ```nix-shell``` that wraps the compiler with the `clang` compiled in step 2, fetches all the dependencies and sets the appropriate environment variables, compile the runtime library and exit the ```nix-shell```:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git checkout default.nix
$ nix-shell
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/runtime
$ make clean && make
$ exit
```

Optional compile parameter for `SPP runtime library`: `TAG_BITS` to determine the tag size for the returned tagged pointer structure.

**Important**: If you use this parameter, this has to be passed to `SPP PMDK` building phase below (Step 4) as well as to any compiling module of your own (so that it does not mess up with the internal struct definitions).

4. **Build the `SPP PMDK` fork:**

Revert the `default.nix` to its original form, enter a ```nix-shell``` that wraps the compiler with the `clang` compiled in step 2 and fetches all the dependencies and sets the appropriate environment variables, compile the `SPP PMDK` fork and exit the ```nix-shell```:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT
$ git checkout default.nix
$ nix-shell
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk
$ git checkout spp-pm_ptr_bit
$ make clean -j$(nproc)
$ make clobber -j$(nproc)
$ make -j$(nproc) TAG_BITS=xx
$ exit
```

Optional compile parameter for `SPP PMDK`: `TAG_BITS` to determine the tag size for the returned tagged pointer structure.

**Important**: If you use this parameter, this has to be passed to `SPP runtime library` building phase above (Step 3) as well as to any compiling module of your own (so that it does not mess up with the internal struct definitions).

5. **Enter in the ```nix-shell``` with all the dependencies and built projects:**
```console
$ nix-shell
nix-shell> # in this shell all build dependencies are present
```

The nix-shell already exports the ```CC```, ```CXX```, ```CMAKE_C_COMPILER```, ```CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER```, ```BINUTILS_DIR```, ```PMEM_MMAP_HINT```, ```PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE``` environment variables.

## Usage instructions

For the instructions below, we assume that you already have completed the [installation steps](#installation-instructions) above and you are in the environment provided by the ```nix-shell```.

### Minimal examples execution

We provide 2 sets of minimal examples.

#### Single source file example 
In the [`examples/simple_example`](./examples/simple_example/) folder you can find a minimal example which can be built and run with the [`launch.sh`](./examples/simple_example/launch.sh) script as follows:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/examples/simple_example
$ ./launch.sh
```
The example opens a persistent memory pool, allocates the root object and performs various accesses and copies. 
It uses the `/dev/shm` for the pool (with the ```PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE``` exported flag, it is handled as PM from the application).
We opted for that option so that this simple example can run in systems without PM.
It also includes some dummy volatile memory actions in the beginning for comparison purposes of the programming model.
When you run the example, it should result in a SEGMENTATION FAULT because of the injected overflow. 
The [`example.c`](./examples/simple_example/example.c) file has some annotated lines that should crash.
Feel free to experiment with those. One of them contains a function that also triggers a PM buffer overflow in the `memcpy` function.
The [`launch.sh`](./examples/simple_example/launch.sh) script also produces the original and transformed LLVM-IR for the simple [`example.c`](./examples/simple_example/example.c) code.

#### Library example
In the [`examples/library_example`](./examples/library_example/) folder you can find a minimal example which can be built and run with the [`launch.sh`](./examples/library_example/launch.sh) script as follows:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/examples/library_example
$ ./launch.sh
```
This examples showcases how SPP treats libraries. Especially, it highlights also one limitation of SPP when an overflow occurs in a shared library and cannot be caught.
We provide the [`libfuncs.h`](./examples/library_example/libfuncs.h) and [`libfuncs.c`](./examples/library_example/libfuncs.c) source code that is built into both a shared (.so) and a static (.a) library.
This library contains code that performs memory access and memory copies.
We provide the [`driver.c`](./examples/library_example/driver.c) code that performs similar steps with the `simple_example` above but instead of performing the memory ations or calling the functions in the single source, it uses the compiled libraries.
Here, we also use the `/dev/shm` for the pool (with the ```PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE``` exported flag, it is handled as PM from the application).
Similarly with the `simple_example`, we opted for that option so that this simple example can run in systems without PM.
When you run the example, it should result in a SEGMENTATION FAULT because of the injected overflow for the case of the `driver_static` produced executable that uses the static library. The `driver_shared` runs normally without an error as the overflow cannot be detected because the tagged pointer is cleared when passed to the external library (clear limitation -- specified also in the paper).
Note the **line 60**: The `driver.c` calls the `test_memcpy` function. In the case of the static library the pointer is not cleared and therefore, the overflow is detected, causing the SEGMENTATION FAULT.
The [`driver.c`](./examples/library_example/driver.c) file has some annotated lines that should crash.
Feel free to experiment with those. 
The [`launch.sh`](./examples/library_example/launch.sh) script also produces the original and transformed LLVM-IR for the [`driver.c`](./examples/library_example/driver.c) code.

### How to easily run pmembench
In the ```nix-shell```, you can run the `pmembench` with the `pmembench_map.cfg` (persistent indices) and `pmembench_tx_spp.cfg` (PM management operations):
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk/src/benchmarks
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../nondebug ./pmembench pmembench_map.cfg
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../nondebug ./pmembench pmembench_tx_spp.cfg
```
Note that this execution directs the output to `stdout`. To store it in a file, simply redirect it to the file of your choice.

To test `pmembench` with the vanilla PMDK (baseline), you can compile the native PMDK with:
```
$ cd PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk/
$ make clobber
$ make clean
$ make -j$(nproc) SPP_OFF=1
```
Then run again the `pmembench` commands as explained above.

**Note**: by default, the `pmembench` uses the `/dev/shm` for the pool (with the ```PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE``` exported flag, it is handled as PM from the application).
We opted for that option so that the `pmembench` can run in systems without PM.
For the SPP [pmembench benchmarks](./benchmarks/pmembench), we [replace]((./benchmarks/pmembench/run_spp.sh)) the path with actual PM to get the reliable measurements.
Feel free to adjust the paths in `pmembench_map.cfg` and `pmembench_tx_spp.cfg` located in `PROJECT_ROOT/pmdk/src/benchmarks` folder of the `pmdk` submodule.

### How to run the tests
After you have successfully compiled `llvm` and the runtime library, you can run our sample tests from the root directory:
```
OPT_LEVEL=1 ./spp_test.sh
```
or
```
OPT_LEVEL=2 ./spp_test.sh
```
depending on the optimization level that you want your binaries to be compiled with.
Note that this command will create a build directory where it will place the binaries,
build the `pmdk`, generate the transformed IRs and run the tests. 
The IRs and the binaries are placed in `build/tests` folder.

#### Note
Currently the passes produce a lot of debug messages. In order to control the debug information, someone can comment out the defined `DEBUG` variables in `runtime/src/spp.c`, `llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/SPP/spp.cpp` and `llvm-project/llvm/lib/Transforms/IPO/SPPLTO.cpp`.
