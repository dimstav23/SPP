## Scripts used for creating the plots in the paper.

### Importing the results in the correct format
`import_pmembench.sh`: Imports the results of the pmembench benchmarks. Supply as the only command line argument the path to the results folder as generated by the benchmark script.
`import_pmemkv.sh`: Imports the results of the pmemkv benchmarks. Supply as the only command line argument the path to the results folder as generated by the benchmark script.

### Generating the plots
`generate_plots.py` : Parses, analyses the results and creates the plots for the respective benchmark by providing as command line argument its .yml file in this directory after the import scripts calls.

`plot_all.sh` : Imports, parses, analyses the results and creates the plots for all the benchmarks under the (created) plots directory. It takes as command line arguments the results folder of the pmembench and pmemkv benchmarks.

### pmembench plots

```
$ ./import_pmembench.sh <path-to-pmembench-results>
$ python3 generate_plots.py plot_config_pmembench_tx.yml
$ python3 generate_plots.py plot_config_maps.yml
```

### pmemkv plots
To produce the pmemkv plots:
```
$ ./import_pmemkv.sh <path-to-pmemkv-results>
$ python3 generate_plots.py plot_config_pmemkv.yml
```
